# Drafter

The purpose of this project is to make a tool that recommends the best characters to choose in the drafting phase of an online game. 
At the moment I am trying out different methods to predict the winner of a game based on the chosen characters. 
Later on the plan is to use Monte Carlo tree search and the best predictor to recommend characters in different phases of the draft.

Have a look at `draft_win_prediction.ipynb` to see more details on the models I am using and their performance.
